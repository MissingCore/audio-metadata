## [Unreleased]

### ðŸ“ˆ Performance fixes

- Reduced the duration of heavy reads (ie: getting the `artwork` metadata) by **up to ~60%** from switching `FileReader.read()` to use `Buffer.readBytes()` instead of `Buffer.readUInt8()` in a for-loop.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-05-30

First "official" release of `@missingcore/audio-metadata`.

> This contains no breaking changes since v0.1.0.

### Added

- Support for reading the following metadata tags from `.flac` (`FLAC`) & `.mp3` (`ID3v1`, `ID3v2`) files: "album", "artist", "artwork", "name", "track", and "year".
- Theoretical support for:
  - Unsynchronisation (ID3v2).
  - Tags located at the end of the file or before the ID3v1 tag (ID3v2.4).
- Support for using either `expo-file-system` or `@dr.pogodin/react-native-fs` for file system interactions (ie: should work with or without using Expo).
- Support for React Native's **"New Architecture"**.

### Changed

- Fixed expo install command & add NPM and License links in "README".
